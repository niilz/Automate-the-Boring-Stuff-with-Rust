This Repo has just been started.

The attempt is: to code along with all programs in "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart...

...BUT to write them in RUST!

This might be the perfect exercise for me to figure out some of RUST's capabilities. And also could potentially provide a nice reference for those who already know a bit about programming but want to have a look how RUST looks and feels.
